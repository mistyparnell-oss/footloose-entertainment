## Image Optimization Guide

### Before Uploading:

1. **Resize images to specified dimensions**
   - Use Photoshop, GIMP, or online tool like Pixlr.com
   - Don't just scale - actually resize to exact pixels

2. **Compress/Optimize**
   - Use TinyPNG.com (free, easy)
   - Or Squoosh.app (Google's tool)
   - Target: 70-80% quality for JPG
   - Should reduce file size 50-70% with minimal quality loss

3. **Check file size**
   - Make sure under max size listed above
   - Smaller = faster loading = better SEO

4. **Test on phone**
   - Images should look good on mobile too
   - Check that important elements aren't cut off

### Naming Convention:
- Use lowercase
- Use hyphens, not spaces
- Be descriptive: `360-photobooth.jpg` not `IMG_1234.jpg`
